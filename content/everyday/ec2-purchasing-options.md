# EC2 Purchasing Options
- On-Demand
- Reversed
- Spot
- Dedicated Hosts

|Metrics|On-Demand|Reserved|Spot|
|-|-|-|-|
|Discount|0%|40%-60%|50%-90%|
|Description|There’s no commitment from you. You pay the most with this option.|1-year or 3-year commitment from you. You save money from that commitment|Ridiculously inexpensive because there’s no commitment from the AWS side.|
|Use Case| Small or experimental project that do not anticipate the need of config to be used or used in a short time such as: <ul><li>Software testing</li><li>Build a system that runs seasonally</li><li>The system needs to be deployed quickly but can stop at any time <b>(actively)</b></li></ul>| A server for long-term purpose| <ul><li>Limited cost</li><li>Applications can stop at any time without affecting the system: Like jobs that need to be processed once requiring high processing speed, CI/CD, ...</li></ul>


# EC2 Spot

## EC2 Spot vs On-Demand
|Metrics|Spot Instances|On-Demand Instances|
|-------|--------------|-------------------|
|Launch time|Launches instantly if the Spot Request is active and capacity is available.|Launches instantly when you make a manual launch request and capacity is available.|
Available capacity|Delivers launch requests until capacity becomes available.|Sends an insufficient capacity error when the request is made and no capacity is available.
Hourly price|Varies depending on supply and demand.|Remains the same.
Rebalance recommendation|Sends a warning signal when the instance is at high risk for interruption.|Continues to run until you terminate or hibernate the instance.
Instance interruption|Interruptible by AWS EC2 when capacity is no longer available, the prices exceed your budgeted max rate, or the demand for Spot instances increases.|Remains uninterrupted until you terminate or hibernate the instance.

## Spot Fleets

Spot Fleets = set of Spot Instances + (optional) On-Demand Instances

The Spot Fleet will try to meet the target capacity with price constraints
- Define possible launch pools: instance type, OS, AZ
- Can have multiple launch pools, so that the fleet can choose the best and most appropriate launch pool
- When the spot fleet either reaches the budget or the capacity, then it will stops launching instances.

Strategies to allocate Spot Instances:
- lowestPrice: from the pool with the lowest price (cost optimization, short workload)
- deversified: distributed across all pools (great for availability, long workloads)
- capacityOptimized: pool with the optimal capacity for the number of instances

<u>Spot Fleets allow us to automatically request Spot Instances with the lowest price</u>
